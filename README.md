Palantír
========

Palantír aims to be an all-round notification center for MacOS X. While the
Palantír App itself doesn't provide any real functionality for the end-user,
it is easily extendable through plugins which will be able to provide any
feature you can think of, e.g. mail or news feed notifications.

## Features

* A central configuration for the App itself and the plugins
* A simple plugin interface to create own Palantír plugin

## Future plans

* A downloadable disk image or installer
* Sparkle integration
* Growl integration
* More dynamic configuration

## Requirements

* MacOS X 10.5 (Leopard) or newer
