    <h1>Palantír</h1>
</div>

Palantír aims to be an all-round notification center for MacOS X. While the
Palantír App itself doesn't provide any real functionality for the end-user, it
is easily extendable through plugins which will be able to provide any feature
you can think of, e.g. mail or news feed notifications.

## Features
- A central configuration for the App itself and the plugins
- A simple plugin interface to create own Palantír plugins
- Built-in support for popups attached to status item's (see the [GMail
  plugin][1] for a sample)

## Requirements
- MacOS X 10.5 or newer

Palantír is still in an early stage of development. If you want to try
it, check [Palantír's GitHub repository][2].

## Future plans
- A downloadable disk image or installer
- Automatic updates through [Sparkle][3]
- [Growl][4] integration
- More dynamic configuration
