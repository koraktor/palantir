</div>

Palantír aims to be an all-round notification center for MacOS X. While the
Palantír App itself doesn't provide any real functionality for the end-user, it
is easily extendable through plugins which will be able to provide any feature
you can think of, e.g. mail or news feed notifications.

## Features
- A central configuration for the App itself and the plugins
- A simple plugin interface to create own Palantír plugins

## Requirements
- MacOS X 10.5 or newer

Palantír is still in an early stage of development. If you want to try
it, check [Palantír's GitHub repository][1].

## Future plans
- A downloadable disk image or installer
- Automatic updates through [Sparkle][2]
- [Growl][3] integration
- More dynamic configuration
